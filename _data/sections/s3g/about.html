S3G is a static site generator written in python. It has support for loops, templates and data stored in external files. Templates and loops use a simple XML format which is easy to use.<br/>
It also has support for plugins which can be added by placing the plugin into the "_plugins" folder. Plugins work in the same way as all of the modules in S3G and are able to control the page content, where the page is saved, variables the page can access and whether the page should be processed at all.
